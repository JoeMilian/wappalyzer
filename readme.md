# wappalyzer

This lib will fetch a url and identify the techs using the definitions from the [Wappalyzer] project.

The Rust version is somewhat limited in comparison to the JS (main) library as we are not running the rules from within a headless browser, but only against the initially-returned html from the main page.

The tradeoff is speed and efficiency as this can run much more efficiently against large sets of webpages.
